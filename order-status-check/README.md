# Node.js Async Refactor: Callback → Promises → Async/Await

This mini-project demonstrates how to convert callback-based async code in Node.js into Promises and then into Async/Await.

## 📦 Scenario: Order Status Check (E-commerce)

Suppose We're building a feature for an e-commerce platform to check order delivery status. Initially, it uses callbacks. You've been asked to modernize the codebase by using Promises and Async/Await.

## 📁 Files Included

- `callbackVersion.js` – Basic version using callbacks
- `promiseVersion.js` – Refactored to use Promises
- `asyncAwaitVersion.js` – Final version using Async/Await

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. Then run:

```bash
node callbackVersion.js
node promiseVersion.js
node asyncAwaitVersion.js
